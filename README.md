<h3>Getting Started</h3>
To view the website, 

To run a website locally, you will need to follow these steps:

Install Node.js on your computer by downloading and installing it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Clone the repository using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git

Replace "username" with your GitHub username and "repo-name" with the name of the repository you want to clone.
Navigate to the cloned repository using the terminal or command prompt.
Install the dependencies required for the project by running the following command:

Copy code
npm install

Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
npm start

Open a web browser and go to the address "http://localhost:3000" to view the website.
You should now be able to view the website locally on your computer. If you make any changes to the code, you will need to stop the server and restart it for the changes to take effect.
